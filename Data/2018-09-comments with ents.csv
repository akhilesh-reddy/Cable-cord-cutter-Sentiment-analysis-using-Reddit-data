0,How to watch the MLB Postseason 2018,"One edit. TBS will have the AL playoffs after the WED Wildcard game on ESPN.  TBS seems to be a basic channel on all services.  FS1 is exclusive for the NL. MLB Network will mix in some games for both the AL and NL divisional series, mostly day games.Another option is the MLB audio At Bat. It gets audio through your browser and their app. It's a good way if your team is playing a lot of day games while at work.

That didn't hold up in court and they were told they needed to sign rebroadcast agreements with the channels that they retransmit over the internet, which bankrupted them.Locast is different because they're a non-profit. They're operating under a clause in the FCC laws that allows non-profits to retransmit OTA broadcasts within the designated market area without getting permission from the broadcasters.

267,Why an Antenna Should Be a Part of Your Cord Cutting Setup,"Yes, a cheap OTA TV antenna (as little as $12 last time I checked) is a no-brainer for many people in the USA; but not all. Because the cost can go up dramatically in rural and/or mountainous areas. We live rural. And have a hill directly between us and the nearest broadcast towers, which effectively blocks the signal, so that nobody in our neighborhood has used an antenna for decades.However, back when we badly needed to cut the cord with cable, we took on the challenge. Now we're the first ever to get practical TV here. Around 25 channels. But it cost us around $600, and a ton of research and DIYing. And yeah: we get all the major broadcasters, plus their subsidiary channels. However, most of these channels are just as eaten up with commercials as cable TV. So these days we rarely use them for anything but convenient access to local weather news during storms. There's usually fewer commercials to be seen on free Roku channel alternatives to the antenna TV shows. At present I think we have around 100 free Roku channels (though I personally regularly use only a handful of them).We also have paid Netflix.The article is wrong about no blackouts/outages with antennas. Weather extremes can certainly cause outages. And certain sporting events held locally will be blacked out for us over the antenna. There's also a major local station here that fairly regularly goes down at the source, which is annoying.Of course, cable TV has outages too.Pic quality is often better via antenna than other ways, as the article says. But not always. Since some channels don't do high def. Or show old TV stuff that's low res.As far as OTA 3.0 is concerned, I wouldn't let that be a factor in decisions whatsoever, as I've seen politicians and companies over-promise and under-deliver on new TV and internet options for decades now.

While many people do save, some do not, and that's okay.Cord cutting doesn't work out financially for everyone.  People with vary wide-ranging tastes, who actually watch most of the channels they have, will likely be better off sticking with traditional subscription TV.  Big families are also frequently better off not cutting the cord, because some family members will like some channels, others will not, and among all of them a large portion of the content is regularly viewed.  For people who have a more narrow taste, or a small family, a lot of money can potentially be saved.  It's also not ONLY about saving money.  It's about user experience.  Some people are willing to pay more to have services that work on all devices and have more specialized or exclusive content available than more traditional services.  Personally?  Most of what I watch is on the big networks or Netflix.  So with an antenna and that one subscription, I have access to 75% of what I used to watch.  The other 25%?

Just have to be patient. One show I no longer have access to has an audio-only podcast that I listen to instead of watching the telecast, because it's a political discussion show so seeing the people talking isn't that important.   If I was dead set on accessing that last 25% still, then yeah, I'd have to subscribe to at least one more streaming provider and HBO.

349,Are we not in a worse situation now?,"This is what I like to call the 'soup of chaos' where there's an explosion of competing offerings which quickly cools off to a handful of competitors and often one dominant champion - and its the third one we've seen since the invention of the FLV video player. It often happens once or twice in the lifecycle of a new technology, but a third time and in such a relatively short time frame is rare. The first version saw websites like Veoh (Disney and Time Warner), Vimeo, and my own GamersTube battling against each other and then against Google's YouTube for on demand videos and views. The second version was the different types of streaming videos which brought us offerings very different to YouTube such as Vine, Meerkat, Twitch.tv, Periscope, Live Stream, UStream, and Facebook Video. Throughout all of these first two versions Netflix stood relatively alone in their model and grew into the powerhouse they are today without having to be owned by another major tech corporation. That's a very difficult feat in today's internet where 'ecosystems' like Google, Amazon, and Facebook rule supreme. We're now deep into rare territory with a third 'soup of chaos' version since FLV and this time the big guys have all figured it out. Disney, AT&T, Comcast, CBS, Amazon, Sony, and Google all have subscription based streaming offerings and Viacom has one on the way.

I used to buy video games for $60 and play them until I got a new game, I've spent that much on FortNite and Rocket League addons this year alone. Strangely the internet has increased our cost of communication and entertainment while simultaneously increasing our quality of life.

449,Antenna not picking up ABC,My TV is facing west. It is right next to a window too. Not sure if that matters at all.,[]
450,Antenna not picking up ABC,"Alright, so, a few questions:1. Does ABC come in well? ABC and CBS are both in the VHF-Hi band.2. Does PBS and Fox come in well? They are all coming from the same 166 degree direction but all on the UHF band.If yes to both, then you have an issue with reception of VHF-Hi signal coming from the 166 degree direction (aka, just the CBS station). You have a few options, but my guess is the location behind the TV is going to be the culprit. Start by removing the amplifier. If there is a lot of noise at the CBS frequency, this can amplify the noise and hurt your cause. If that doesn't work, I would move the antenna somewhere else. For test purposes, try in front of a window that faces the west/southwest/south direction. If you get all the signals in that case, then you know you don't have to go outside with the antenna.Given the TV fool report, you should be able to acquire ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, and Fox without much issue. Whether that requires an outdoor antenna or not will be the result of your testing, but don't give up.

582,Signed up for Youtube.tv AND DirectvNow to test. Questions...,"You are correct about the commercial situation on YouTube. But it doesn’t apply across the board. The VOD mandate typically only occurs on first-run, prime time programming on major networks. NBC is the worst about it with the DVR version almost never available. CBS shows usually drop the VOD after a few weeks. Right now, Fox and ABC programs allow you to watch the DVR version and skip commercials. This doesn’t apply at all on sports programming, off-network reruns, most talk, game shows and local programming.  The degree of annoyance really depends on what you watch.  Directv Now DVR is limited to 20 hours of storage and all recordings are deleted after 30 days. It gives you very little control over the type and number of episodes recorded. If you want to record a few episodes of The Big Bang Theory, you could find your entire DVR library wiped out in a day or two as it records reruns of TBBT off a variety of networks. And there are repeated instances of programs not recording at all, shortened recordings, poor quality recordings. DTVN calls it a “beta”, but reality is the DVR has been in beta since at least August 2017. Why they can’t get it right remains a mystery. DTVN was promising an expanded DVR option (supposedly by Summer 2018) with more storage and longer retention for an extra fee. YTTV gives you unlimited recording space and stores recordings for 9 months. I spent more than a year on DTVN before switching to YTTV due to their utter inability to fix everything wrong with the service. The highest praise you’ll ever hear for DTVN is that the price is great—usually from AT&T wireless customers who get discounts or those who are on grandfathered pricing. That’s basically the only selling point for DTVN right now. In terms of ease of use, features, supported devices and reliability, it’s at the bottom of the barrel.

You’ll have to pay for their normal programming package and most charge a nominal monthly fee for the cablecard ($2-5 per month.)If you want a streaming alternative, Silicon Dust has their own streaming plan for $35 per month which includes ESPN, Discovery, FX, etc. It’s a decent entry level plan but is missing many niche channels if you have specific interests. No Regional Sports Stations, no NBA/MLB/NFL, has FX but not FXX or FXMovies, etc. There are certainly advantages to local storage of recordings. However as a fellow YTTV user, one thing I didn’t like about this was the loss of the VOD library. YTTV and other streaming services blend that content pretty seamlessly. If you start recording a show with Episode 4, YTTV typically pulls the prior VOD episodes into your library. With a DVR solution like this, you only get what you record.

It seemed so choreographed and even his opponent Lucas was caught smiling right after he was TKO'd.     So many fights just seem rigged and it seems so hard to get great fighters to fight each other.  It took Floyd vs Manny l at least 5 years just to fight.   UFC has alot of great fight cards on FS1 for free, the fights are not rigged,  they fight more often and they usually are able to get guys to agree to fight each other.    In boxing, after a fight, fans talk about how a fight was rigged or this person got robbed.In UFC, after fights, fans talk about the knockout and usually the worst they talk about is if a ref stepped in too early and stopped a fight.

1297,DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,"TL;DR: I like it and see it’s potential amidst its current shortcomings. I am 45, and I am enjoying it. After collecting comics for 15 years I stopped about 20 years ago. So the “older comics” some complain about are many that are new to me. It’s been fun catching up on titles I hadn’t heard of/read in the last 20 years. I can definitely understand if you have been reading comics recently, it might be “light” in the offering of the older stuff. I like there is media to watch as well. “Batman: The Animated Series” debuted when I was in college so there is a lot of nostalgia there. so have thoroughly enjoyed watching those again with my kids. B:TAS is worth the cost of admission in my personal opinion.  (Though I have my eyes on the HD remastered boxed set about to release!)I’m willing to give DC Universe some time before judging it too harshly. It will take time to build out the service. It took Marvel Unlimited, which I subscribe to as well, several years before it was worth the yearly cost, in my opinion. Only now is Marvel Unlimited really worth what they charge. Even Marvel Unlimited doesn’t have everything new or recent. They’ve had to pick and choose what they post. They started the service with the big crossovers and have since filled in with “regular issues.” I bet DC does this as well. I’m not going to put much judgement on the original programming until I actually see it. Here is why: I listened to the critics and the general opinions on “Justice League” and did not see it in the theaters. I watched it a few months ago on a long air flight. I really enjoyed it. Did it have its flaws? Of course, but honestly I enjoyed it more than “Infinity War.” I liked that DC kept the big bad pretty true to the comics. In the movie, Steppenwolf was an unabashed evil guy. DC didn’t retcon a backstory to make him a “sympathetic” character like Disney/Marvel does all their villains. Steppenwolf, though an odd choice of big bad (unless they were trying to kick off an Apokalypse multi-movie story arc) was bad. He wanted to finish his original mission of conquering Earth. Period. No daddy issues (Hela, Loki, Ultron) or making the big bad cry after he wiped out half the universe (Thanos). All that to say, I’ll give “Titans” “Swamp Thing” and the others a shot. Though they look bad in the trailers, they might turn out good, like the “Justice League” movie. Everyone’s mileage will vary, but I’m enjoying it. :)","[('45', 'DATE'), ('15 years', 'DATE'), ('about 20 years ago', 'DATE'), ('the last 20 years', 'DATE'), ('Batman', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('release!)I’m', 'PERSON'), ('DC Universe', 'ORG'), ('Marvel Unlimited', 'PERSON'), ('several years', 'DATE'), ('DC', 'GPE'), ('“Justice League”', 'ORG'), ('a few months ago', 'DATE'), ('“Infinity War', 'EVENT'), ('DC', 'GPE'), ('Steppenwolf', 'ORG'), ('DC', 'ORG'), ('Disney/Marvel', 'ORG'), ('Steppenwolf', 'ORG'), ('Apokalypse', 'PRODUCT'), ('Earth', 'LOC'), ('Hela', 'GPE'), ('Loki', 'PERSON'), ('Ultron', 'ORG'), ('half', 'CARDINAL'), ('Thanos', 'ORG'), ('Titans', 'NORP'), ('“Swamp Thing', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('the “Justice League”', 'ORG')]"

1495,Why don't streaming boxes have a built-in way to keep track of watched and/or new episodes?,"It makes sense that Tivo or any other DVR working on a cable system can do this, because it's actually recording that content locally, from a single source, and indexing all that metadata.Roku is nothing more than a computer that can run various discrete apps developed by the streaming platforms. To the extent that the Roku itself can gather and provide to you information about what you've already watched on say, Hulu, it's not because it's keeping track of what you're watching in the moment as it's playing. Even if it could do that, that would only give you that information on *that* specific Roku. Which wouldn't be very useful for people watching on multiple devices. Rather, it's able to do this because the Hulu app developer has exposed that watch history data via an API and the Roku devs have built functionality to use it.I've never used WatchAid, but it sounds like it just gathers public information about certain shows (when new ones are released) and then just helps you get to that content on your platform of choice. Does it also somehow keep track of what you've watched on those platforms? If it does, I'm guessing it does that by logging into that platform on your behalf and collecting your watch history data.Hulu does have a search functionality that can search for specific content across all platforms. But it doesn't need any information about *your* account to do that. It simply needs to know publicly-available show release info, and cross-reference that with what apps you happen have installed on your Roku.tl;dr: this type of functionality is possible only if the individual streaming platforms expose that data to Roku and Roku is programmed to collect, organize, and display it back to you in a helpful way.Apologies if I've misunderstood your question. Cheers.EDIT: Thinking about it some more, I suppose that if Roku wanted to just unilaterally monitor and log your watching behavior/keep track of played episodes/etc., it could at least sync that information back to your Roku account, and it would be available on your other Rokus.

Sling Orange - you get ESPN, ESPN2 and TNT.  A majority of the good games are there and it's like $25 a month.  ABC - Over the air HD antenna. I have not looked at how to get subscriptions for network channels. Local games - This is where it gets tricky.  All of my local games are on Fox Sports 1 which is part of ANOTHER Sling package that doesn't include ESPN or TNT.  So you could get a package that includes both but now you're pretty much paying cable prices ($40).  NBA League Pass - You can get all the games EXCEPT the ones on national t.v. (TNT, ESPN, ABC) and/or on your regional channel (FS1 in my case).  This sucks because every year there are good match-ups exclusively on TNT and ESPN that you will miss out on if you just get league pass.My choice: Last couple of seasons I got the Sling package that included TNT and ESPN and I have an over the air antenna for ABC games.  I did not care to watch my local team because, well, they have sucked for the last few years and I know I wasn't missing much (LOL). I would order right before the season started and end it right after it ended (or the Finals begin since all of those games are on ABC).  It used to be $19.99, then $22 and now it's $25.  It has gotten progressively better with the exception of a few seconds of lag from real time.  The only reason this sucks is that if you are watching it and discussing the game real time online with other fans, then they see the action before you do and your comments are slightly delayed.. OR they could tell you spoilers (like for example if a game winning shot went in or not).  For THIS season there is a lot of interest in my local team and I think I might bite the bullet and get the Sling Orange + Blue package for $40. My cable t.v. has a promo package for $45 that includes 125 channels (including TNT, ESPN and FS1).  I am seriously considering going the cable route because it's only $5 more and it is in true real time and less chance of interruption.

If you were to give up on ABC you could try a high gain UHF band antenna which would tend to reject the strong signal in the band it is not designed for. Such an antenna would be significantly smaller as well.

You would probably at least get Fox. You could use this preamp:* RCA RCATVPRAMP1R (has separate VHF/UHF inputs)... and connect your antenna to the UHF input.

You can't start watching a program that is being recorded in ""delayed mode""; we often start watching a program being recorded about 20 minutes in so we can skip the commercials.The rest of the DVR functions are fine, and I suspect Amazon's version will be very similar to Google's Live Channels. I also have a HD Homerun which is the same as the Recast (a network OTA streamer) but also has the ability to stream Silicon Dust's ""Premium TV"" skinny bundle. And, it can record those streamed cable channels on it's $35 a year DVR. The Fire TV devices support the HD Homerun through its app. The disadvantages are that you need some kind of network storage or media server to store the recordings on, and the DVR user interface is ... odd.

I listed out all the shows I was watching and looking up the dates for the next season. Basically all of them have been pushed to 2019 - 2020, so no real reason to have live TV this fall for me. I only have a handful of shows currently airing that I'd actually purchase outright, so I'll save significantly with season passes ($20 - $40 each x 6) over monthly service ($45 x 12).

Binge Watching.I used to subscribe to Netflix consistently, ever since they first offered streaming. Recently I figured out that I just don't watch it as much as I used to. Yes, I watch certain shows, but I tend to binge-watch them, and then I leave Netflix alone for a month or two before going back and watching another in the same manner.So I canceled them. Every few months I go back if there's a new show, and I binge-watch it over the course of a few days. When I've exhausted their collection of shows or movies that I'm interested in, I cancel again and save myself another few months of subscription fees. I do the same with HBO Now, but for currently-airing shows. When GoT or Westworld are on new seasons, I subscribe and watch for the couple months they're active. Then when the season is over I cancel and wait for the new seasons. Amazon Prime Video is different, since it's tied to my Prime account and I use that for other things. That stays constant. Hulu I'll subscribe to once a year, maybe, if there's something good and exclusive. So far, I'm not impressed enough to stay past the 1 month trial. I do not watch sports, so I don't bother with any ""live"" TV packages. They're annoying and not worth it to me. I hate commercials, and I hate viewing by appointment.

But it's your choice. I just think they're taking advantage of your addiction to sports, is all. It's a lot cheaper and simpler if you just stop giving a damn about sports. Try it.

2223,Comcast promo offers VS cord cutting,"So some fees to keep in mind they aren’t telling you about are: broadcast fee ($8), regional sports fee ($6.50), franchise fee ($5), and HD tech fee ($10) if it’s not included for the first year. Then you’ll need to calculate the DVR costs if they don’t provide one included, plus the other outlets or TVs you’ll want your service on. I believe each extra outlet is like $5 or $10 a month. If you can find a streaming service that covers all or most of your bases, I’d suggest you go with them. For me, I’m missing out on HBO, PAC 12, and NFL Network/RedZone with YouTube TV, but I wouldn’t go back all things considered. Not having to pay those fees, to me, is so freeing and invigorating that it’s worth sacrificing a few channels. The major caveat here, though, is to know what the internet-only plans are going to be.

2366,Apple's Upcoming Streaming Service Is Reportedly So Bland Staff Are Calling It 'Expensive NBC',"If you're any kind of semi-decent parent, then you will understand the intent - if not the execution.  I'm not an overprotective parent, but while he was growing up I didn't want my kid exposed to mature stuff too early and cause him to grow up jaded because he'd seen it all by the time he was 13 or something. That kind of crap is practically *everywhere* nowadays with so few exceptions that it's gotten very hard to avoid exposing underaged kids to concepts like being ""sexy,"" ""popular,"" or worse: ""sluts.""  Preteens shouldn't be worrying about that stuff yet - it really affects their sociological development and how they think and look at the world as they grow up. They often wind up being train wrecks for the rest of their lives because how they think of things has become so skewed.My kid's in his mid-teens now and I pretty much treat him like an adult because I know he's getting exposed to that stuff by now without any help from me. I feel not pretending he isn't exposed to it and giving him the respect of not hiding from the fact it exists is what's kept the lines of communication open between us even though he's definitely in his rebellious teen phase. He knows he can come to me with any topic he may want to talk about and I won't belittle him (although I admit to sometimes teasing him because he obviously didn't even *try* to think about something before asking).

2507,"Trying to convince family to ditch Direct TV, but my Dad needs to watch the news every morning","This is long.. but don't be scared! Getting local TV over the air is similar to getting a radio station over the air. All TVs sold in the US contain the necessary cards to support broadcast TV. However, TV has all moved to Digital, which means you can't access channels unless a re-scan on your TV to find them all first. Re-scanning is pretty easy to do, just go into your TV menu, usually it's under ""Channel"" or ""Signal"" or something like that.Before even looking into an antenna, you'll need to figure out how close/easy to receive the station you're looking for will be. I've linked the FCC site below, put in your address and see if it's towards the top of the list. There's also TV Fool, which tends to be more detailed but slightly out of date. Check both. Also take into account if you live in a building with thick walls or in a neighborhood with a lot of trees, they will make signals harder to receive. If you're in the green on both TVfool and the FCC sites, it should be possible to get it with an indoor antenna.I'm assuming you're going to want at least Newschannel 9 (Chattanooga), with the callsign WTVC. TVfool has a callsign lookup with a guide for indoor/outdoor reception. Plug ""WTVC"" in there and check your neighborhood. It looks like that station still broadcasts on Channel 9, so you're going to want an antenna that supports VHF at least, more on that at the very end.If you've checked the resources, and getting the stations you want over the air is possible, it's time to get an antenna. You can spend really as much as you want, I've linked to the Winegard flatwave below which is recommended by the sub and fairly cheap. If the rating an TVfool for the station you want is below 50 or so NM (dB) there's an amplified version.https://www.fcc.gov/media/engineering/dtvmapshttps://www.tvfool.com/https://www.amazon.com/Winegard-FlatWave-FL-5000-High-VHF-Ultra-Thin/dp/B0063705PE/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1537677684&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=winegard+flatwave&psc=1","[('US', 'GPE'), ('Digital', 'ORG'), ('Channel', 'ORG'), ('Signal', 'ORG'), ('FCC', 'ORG'), ('TVfool', 'ORG'), ('FCC', 'ORG'), ('Newschannel 9', 'LAW'), ('WTVC', 'ORG'), ('TVfool', 'ORG'), ('WTVC', 'ORG'), ('Channel 9', 'ORG'), ('Winegard', 'PERSON'), ('50 or so', 'CARDINAL'), ('NM', 'GPE')]"

I find it to be a generally bad idea to convince ""older"" people to cord cut.  Most over 40 are to tied to the old way of watching tv and/or have no time or desire to learn how to do cord cutting right so it still delivers the programming they want at a significant cost reduction.  Part of this is also because the younger generation trying to urge them to do so lacks the ability to truly do a cost analysis to make sure it is even worth it for someone to cut the cord and just spout off nonsensical statements about how much money can be saved without truly knowing the situation.  For some cord cutting is great and saves money - but not for all.

Also, if op isnt' smart enough to know that the local news and gma are available ota he probably shouldn't be advising anyone on cord cutting.

2834,"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices","I just went through this whole decision-tree for our household. What you decide boils down to whether or not you value watching live OTA broadcasts in their native format in real-time with 0 degradation in the video or audio. If you want that then you won't go with a Tablo and you'll probably start getting FireTV devices. The Fire streaming devices support the native MPEG2 stream that is hitting your antenna which makes them ideal playback clients for OTA. Any tuner you use (like HDHR) can send the signal straight to the player the second it receives it without needing to transcode the whole signal into a different format. Roku doesn't support the native broadcast format so it requires a lot of hardware intervention before any OTA broadcast gets onto your TV and everything is slower. Tablo is the same, it just acts like it's own server. You hear Tablo owners talking about how excited they are that it only takes 6s to change channels now instead of 11s. They may be happy, but I wouldn't be. That doesn't work for us. It's because the Tablo is transcoding EVERYTHING it receives OTA and to me this is just ridiculous. It's a beautiful high-quality stream straight off your antenna and you've got a device in the way intercepting it that won't simply just pass the stream to a client on your own network without compressing it and transcoding it first. Then you end up with slow as hell channel changes, you are behind the real-time broadcast, your video quality isn't as good, and you've got this Tablo turning into a space heater it's working so hard all the time. Did you know people are selling aftermarket cooling fans for Tablos now bc they get so hot working so hard all the time?Eventually you'll come to the same conclusion I did that bc the Fire streaming devices support the native broadcast format that they make the most sense as playback clients for OTA. I have an HDHR 4 Tuner Connect sending the native unaltered broadcast feed straight from my antenna, routed through my laptop that's used as a server, and playing back on 3 televisions without any transcoding whatsoever bc the Fire devices don't need transcoding to play it. Channel changes are instant, no buffering, the video quality is outstanding and you wouldn't even realize the laptop was even plugged in it's totally silent and room temperature. I have a 4th TV in the living room that is still on a Roku and playback is slow. It's about 10s between channel changes, if all my devices are on the same channel the Roku is way behind real-time, the video quality is not as good, and my laptop has to work and you'll hear the fan come alive. When you care about OTA television and there's an ideal and cheap playback client out there made by Amazon that's WAY better for OTA playback then you go for it bc it works so much better for that purpose.","[('Tablo', 'PERSON'), ('MPEG2', 'ORG'), ('OTA', 'ORG'), ('HDHR', 'ORG'), ('second', 'ORDINAL'), ('Roku', 'PERSON'), ('Tablo', 'PERSON'), ('Tablo', 'PERSON'), ('11s', 'DATE'), ('Tablo', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Tablo', 'GPE'), ('Tablos', 'PERSON'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('4th', 'ORDINAL'), ('Roku', 'GPE'), ('about 10s', 'DATE'), ('Roku', 'GPE'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('WAY', 'ORG')]"

3193,"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...","'Cord Cutting' means different things to different people; but i think we all agree it means getting rid of cable or satellite TV.  But to me, that's just trading one cord for another; like you said, Sling, PS Vue, YTTV, and others offer the same thing, but through a different technology (the internet).  IMO, we have gone nowhere other than provide more competition with DISH, DirectTV, Comcast, and more.  It's a good thing, because it drives down competition, but I think that the original goal (at least for me) was to force someone to offer a pricing model that includes a-la-carte channel lineups based on our preferences.Upon reading your concerns, I decided to do a quick analysis of my Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) since cutting the cord (which I will provide in the next paragraph) based on my memory and available records.  I concluded that Over-the-Air (OTA) is definitely the way to go.  \*Note that when I was a DISH customer, I was also a Netflix and Amazon Prime customer, so I did not take those costs into account for this analysis since I do not view it as an 'additional' cord-cutting expense; I would have subscribed to those whether or not I cut the cord.  Same thing goes for my internet service: it's not an 'additional cost' so I don't count it.During my time as a DISH Network customer, I never modified my plan.  However, prices slowly rose from 29.99/mo up to $54.99/mo over the course of my 41 months as their customer.  The reason I cancelled was because I received notification it was raising to $59.99/mo.  The average cost of ownership was $40.41 per month, with TCO of $1657.09 sunk into DISH network (including installation fees, taxes, DVR service, etc).  At the end of that service, I had nothing to show for all that sunk cost, I had to ship back the DVR and satellite dish.  Since I cut the cord it has been 40 months.  At first I bought a cheap Antenna ($30), a TabloTV with lifetime subscription service (equip+service=$350), and a Roku TV ($199).  For that initial $580 startup cost, I had pretty much lifetime OTA HDTV with no extra cost forever (or, until they update the signals to something my tablo can't decode, which will likely be a minimum of 20 years, but likely more).  Thus TCO for this cord-cutting setup = $580 and the average cost per month to-date is $14.50 (this number will get smaller as i continue to incur $0 in service fees for OTA).But I think this is a bit of a deceiving number, because after that initial setup, I sunk more costs in equipment to better use my new 'free' service.  These costs are all completely optional, but recommended.  I upgraded from a 2-tuner Tablo to a 4-Tuner Tablo ($299, but I didn't have to pay another subscription fee).  I upgraded from a 32"" TV to a 55"" TV ($510).  I upgraded to a better omnidirectional Mohu Sky60 antenna ($89) so that I could get more channels (went up from 22 channels to 55 channels).

Tell them you are looking to switch to their competition. Now, the key to this argument strategy is that you don't want them to immediately disconnect your service - you want them to schedule a disconnect in 2 weeks so you have enough time to get your new service installed. Bring up the promotion and say if there was anyway to get those prices you would stay, but since you can't looks like you gotta go. If those negotiations fall through, schedule the disconnect in 2 weeks. This gives you the time to decide what you really want, because you can always cancel the disconnect if you change your mind (within those 2 weeks).

The stream YTTV is getting from ESPN may be overloaded. Try logging into the ESPN app with your YTTV credentials and see if it’s any better. - Problem with your network hardware. WiFi is good in many cases but not all. If you have a $300 mesh system that’s only about a year old, you should be good. But if it’s a $50 D-link or something provided by the cable company, you could be getting interference or be in the early stages of an equipment failure.

YTTV, Vue and other live services are streaming dozens of channels live across the country. There’s a lot more potential for failure.

Some folks have told me their TCL have faired much better, and I have also heard that the 4k Roku TVs come with far better Roku hardware than the 1080P sets like the Insignia I got. Crashing aside, I like the Roku interface as a Smart TV because at least the ‘channels’ seem to be updated every so often and from what I can tell the vast majority of services are represented. My only concern is if I switch to a universal remote, input switching seems tedious and maybe wouldn’t work well with remotes that automate the input switching process, since hdmi inputs are like apps that you select on the screen.

3625,Choosing a TV for OTA,"I have that exact same TCL you are thinking of getting, and I highly recommend you get it.  Roku TVs will ALWAYS continue to receive updates as long as Roku stays in business.  They don't leave old models behind (at least, they haven't yet).  I have 4 Roku TVs and they all update with the same features.  It's not like other TV vendors who leave their own proprietary OS's in the dust.I got my first two Roku TVs about 4 years ago; the reason we went with Roku was because my wife loved that we didn't have to switch inputs to watch streaming services vs regular TV.  When I bought them, my first two Roku TVs could 'only' tune to apps and OTA channels.  The hardware was very bare-bones and didn't do much anything except turn the tv on/off.  However, they eventually update themselves.  Examples: Roku released a feature that allowed you to 'silently' watch TV by plugging in headphones to your Remote.  This appeared to only work on newer models that came with a remote that included a headphone jack.  But they don't leave their loyal customers behind.  They add the function to their Roku App, so any smartphone with the Roku App can now use the 'silent listening' feature, even if they have old Roku devices.Another feature that suddenly popped up onto my Roku TVs: a 'guide-style' OTA channel lineup, which allows you to see what is currently on and what is coming on over the next 72 hours, without having to channel surf.  This is a new feature as of about 2 years ago.  Also, the ability to plug in a USB drive to the TVs so that you can pause live TV is a feature that was added via a software update, and it's all free; included with the TV, no add-on service required!!My setup: 1x Tablo DVR at the circuit breaker (where the OTA cable comes into the house) ($150 device + $150 lifetime DVR subscription)1x Mohu Sky 60 sitting on top of a bookshelf on the second floor (where there happens to be a CATV cable wired from the circuit breaker where the Tablo is located) ($80 on sale) 65"" Roku TV (HDR) in my home theater room (basement) ($799)40"" Roku TV (HDR) in my bedroom on the second floor ($299 on sale)55"" Roku TV (HD) above my fireplace in the Family Room (I think i paid $599 for it)32"" Roku TV (HD) in the Guest Bedroom ($199 on sale)With the Tablo setup, I can have as many devices as I want.  Yes, there is a 4-tuner limit, but we never have 4 people watching live TV at the same time.  I can easily get another Roku TV for my kids room and have OTA TV, Netflix, Hulu, and whatever apps I want set up on that TV pretty much instantly.  No additional wires needed, I just have to connect it to my home Wifi.  If you choose not to use the Tablo, you can still plug in your OTA wires to the Roku TVs.  They actually handle OTA quite well, I like the large font and on-screen channel guide; it's really slick, and I feel sorta bummed that I don't get to use it!!  But the Tablo DVR ability is well worth it!!As an added bonus, all the Roku TV remotes are exactly the same (except for the app shortcut buttons) and they work on all Roku Devices, so we have like 12 of them in our house because they are easy to fall in between the couch cushions or left somewhere out-of-place, and you can get 2 extras for like 15 bucks on Amazon.  Plus, in a pinch, you can use your smartphone as a remote for any TV.Oh, and with the Tablo, you can watch your recorded or live OTA remotely through your laptop or mobile device.  The only way you are limited with the tablo is that you must have a device that can load the Tablo App, which includes pretty much every popular streaming device (Roku, Amazon, Google, Xbox, Android, and any web browser except Microsoft Edge), but does NOT include other 'smart tvs' like LG, Samsung, Sony, Vizio, or others.  So all the nay-sayers out there are wrong.  Roku is absolutely awesome.  If you prefer functionality and convenience, then go for it.

Though I recommend going for a model with at least some HDR support if you can afford it, since that's a bigger deal in modern TVs than 4K in my opinion.* Get it from a store with a good return policy.

3716,Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"https://www.outline.com/bnwPjeTo read the whole article without the subscribe BS.The online-only television bundles that have lured away cable-TV customers with rock-bottom prices might not stay that low for long.AT&T Inc.’s DirecTV Now streaming service recently raised its basic channel plan by $5 over the summer, bringing its starting monthly cost to $40. Chief Executive Randall Stephenson this week said the company is considering additional price increases for the service.“We moved the price up and, being a very price-sensitive market, we fully expected to see a considerable number of customers drop off,” Mr. Stephenson said in an interview Wednesday. “We haven’t seen that. The consumers, it’s obvious that they’re finding value in the platform.”Streaming services like DirecTV Now, Sling TV, PlayStation Vue and YouTube TV added millions of customers last year by promising big savings over traditional cable and satellite-TV subscriptions. Sling sold its channel package for $20.DirecTV Now’s basic price is “for the long haul probably still too low,” Mr. Stephenson said. He said the service has been unprofitable, and the company wants to steer the most frugal customers to its slimmer WatchTV service, which carries no sports channels and is profitable.Mr. Stephenson said WatchTV could offer a range of packages from $15 to $25 a month to appeal to more people. “We’ll exit this year with a very different looking portfolio,” he said.Market leader SlingTV this summer raised the price of its basic package by $5 to $25 a month, with its owner Dish Network Inc. blaming higher channel programming fees.“Our team works hard to negotiate fair programming deals, with the goal of keeping your price as low as possible,” Dish executive Warren Schlichting said in a blog post. “Programming fees, however, only go one direction, and that’s up!”The price increases reflect how skinny TV bundles are getting girthier as they add more channels. A Sling TV spokeswoman said the company plans to add more channels from Discovery Inc. later this year without raising prices.Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube TV service, which carries cable channels and went live last year at $35 a month, raised its monthly price to $40 earlier this year after it tacked on additional channels like TNT and TBS.The higher prices have also narrowed the value gap between new and traditional TV, since cord-cutters must still pay for broadband service. Cable-TV packages still cost more than their online imitators, though cable companies often charge higher rates for standalone broadband service as an enticement to bundle internet and video.For example, Comcast Corp.’s website currently offers new customers a bundle with 125 TV channels and broadband service for $70 a month for 12 months, rising to $90 in the second year of the 2-year contract. For a broadband-only service, with a slower internet connection, Comcast’s starting price is $40 a month, rising to $75 after 12 months.Price increases at the low end of the live TV market aren’t deterring new customers. More than 9 million subscribers will be using streaming services by the end of this year, growing to 24 million by 2022, according to estimates from investment bank UBS AG . A UBS survey found most customers had switched to the services to save money.“The fact that consumers can’t afford the [traditional cable-TV] bundle is the main issue,” said Charter Communications Inc. Chief Executive Tom Rutledge this week at a Goldman Sachs Group investor conference. Still, he said the idea that the traditional cable TV market is “falling apart” is overblown.“The traditional model is gradually declining,” he said.","[('https://www.outline.com/bnwPjeTo', 'ORG'), ('AT&T Inc.', 'ORG'), ('DirecTV Now', 'PRODUCT'), ('5', 'MONEY'), ('the summer', 'DATE'), ('monthly', 'DATE'), ('40', 'MONEY'), ('Randall Stephenson', 'PERSON'), ('this week', 'DATE'), ('Stephenson', 'PERSON'), ('Wednesday', 'DATE'), ('platform.”Streaming', 'GPE'), ('Sling TV', 'ORG'), ('PlayStation Vue', 'PRODUCT'), ('YouTube TV', 'ORG'), ('millions', 'CARDINAL'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('Sling', 'ORG'), ('20.DirecTV', 'MONEY'), ('Now', 'DATE'), ('Stephenson', 'PERSON'), ('WatchTV', 'GPE'), ('Stephenson', 'PERSON'), ('WatchTV', 'GPE'), ('$15 to $25', 'MONEY'), ('a month', 'DATE'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('SlingTV', 'PERSON'), ('this summer', 'DATE'), ('$5 to $25', 'MONEY'), ('Dish Network Inc.', 'ORG'), ('Dish', 'NORP'), ('Warren Schlichting', 'PERSON'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Sling', 'NORP'), ('Discovery Inc.', 'ORG'), ('later this year', 'DATE'), ('Alphabet Inc.', 'ORG'), ('YouTube TV', 'ORG'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('35', 'MONEY'), ('monthly', 'DATE'), ('40', 'MONEY'), ('earlier this year', 'DATE'), ('TNT', 'ORG'), ('Cable-TV', 'ORG'), ('Comcast Corp.’s', 'ORG'), ('125', 'CARDINAL'), ('70', 'MONEY'), ('12 months', 'DATE'), ('90', 'MONEY'), ('the second year', 'DATE'), ('2-year', 'CARDINAL'), ('Comcast', 'ORG'), ('40', 'MONEY'), ('75', 'MONEY'), ('12 months', 'DATE'), ('More than 9 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('the end of this year', 'DATE'), ('24 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('2022', 'DATE'), ('UBS AG', 'ORG'), ('UBS', 'ORG'), ('money.“The', 'ORG'), ('Charter Communications Inc.', 'ORG'), ('Tom Rutledge', 'PERSON'), ('this week', 'DATE'), ('Goldman Sachs Group', 'ORG')]"

3733,Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"I will give you this advice that I have been handing out in here for a long time.If you have Cable Tv and you are someone that watches a lot of rerunsif you watch movies on AMC FX FXX whatever..Then get yourself a Cable Card Tuner and get a cablecard from your cable company. Normally they don't charge you for the first cable card and with that and a tuner you can record up to 6 shows at a time. Then get yourself a NAS Server and fill it with cheap 5TB drives or whatever is cheapest in your price range.. don't buy NAS drives get external USB drives because they are the cheapest and take them out of the box and put them in your NASThen you need something like a Windows 7 computer with Windows Media Center to record your shows and movies.If you pick a show like Family Guy or The Simpsons you can record all ten + years of the shows in just a couple months.. but what you should do is record any show that you consider watchable.. you will soon realize just how many shows are available in rerun or even new shows that rerun.&#x200B;I havent counted recently but I am guessing I am in the 25000 range i can't really remember.&#x200B;If you don't have cable and you have good antenna reception and get quite a few networks you can do the same thing with a TV Antenna Tuner. You can get a single tuner for $15 or you can get a 4 tuner for $100 and there are tons of movies and shows on Antenna that you are not watching because they are on at 3am in the morning or because they are on a different station and you are watching Big Brother on CBS.&#x200B;I started off with a Antenna Tuner.. then I moved to using that tuner hooked to my cable box out and recording one show at a time using a special setup that changes stations automatically and records in the background..&#x200B;Then in preparation for cutting the cord I got a 4 tuner Ceton Cable Card tuner and I got a Netgear NAS that runs android over linux and put four 5 TB drives in it that I got on black friday sales&#x200B;I also use software to take the original large file media center makes and reduces it to 720 and converts it to HVEC h.265 this makes my shows and movies tiny in size but since they started out as 1080 they are sharp enough to scale even on a 40inch tv if you are 8 feet away from it... which is fine.. thats the tradeoff i make to have lots and lots and lots of movies and tv shows.&#x200B;Then you get a tv box that can access the NAS.. I chose a cheap Android Box that is really great at hvec h.265 .. that option was my primary concern.. that box also lets me watch youtube and other free websites with free legal content as a supplement to what i have recorded and what I get over antenna.&#x200B;You are going to pay for a setup like this but you can build it over time.. start with a 5tb external drive and save all your shows and movies to that.. once you get that filled you will be ready to buy a NAS because you will have done your research for the cheapest way to build it and maybe by then 6 or 8tb drives will be as cheap as the 5tb drives who knows.&#x200B;But that is your option.. I am going to do a quick scan to see how many tv shows i have saved....&#x200B;While that is running I will say you have to optimize what you can.. and if it means getting cable again for a year or 6 months so you can record insane amounts of shows.. well you do that.. and then they are yours legally as long as you don't share them with anyone.I have about 300 into my antenna system which is 2 large antennas pointed at 2 different cities.. baltimore and Philly and i also get DC sometimes and a few channels from jersey... a lot of it is duplicates but those duplicates are good when there is weather conditions blocking one or the other city.ok so I have 32,455 tv shows recorded.. I believe I have about 2000 movies .. is this stuff great content? IDK probably not.. but I do have all of the batman, 007, clint eastwood, transformers, harry potter, startrek, star wars, jaws, and so on .. I got tons of B&W movies and Westerns and KungFu and you know.. and on top of that I have lots of TV Shows.. Some of the TV Shows I have to delete because I went overboard and started recording stuff like bewitched and I dream of Jeanie and stuff like that but I do have quite a few series that are really good ..So I am not hurting so much that I need a Netflix account or some other pay account..the only pay account I have is free shows off amazon prime video that come with my free shipping.. and I wouldn't have that except I have a situation where prime shipping is pretty much necessary for my family at this time.But there is so much stuff you can record.. you can't record encrypeted channels like HBO or even ESPN here at least.. and some systems have a lot of DRM Encryption on their stations so its not good for everyone .. but when I was recording on average 4+ shows at a time.. I would have scheduling conflicts because I had it cranked up so much it was just sucking every tv show off the system..I strongly suggest this to you if you are an enthusiast and have basic computer skills... I also suggest you get an antenna even if you arent going to record because you can normally find something that is entertaining enough to watch.but yeah.. I called this a long time ago.. and the worst part is that no one is even talking aboutIP based services like this can not be recorded to your own devices.. you have to continue using their services to use their cloud.. to access recordings that may or may not get deleted..What I record off antenna or cable .. I get to keep foreverwell thats my suggestion and thats pretty much why this sub exists.. to help people do this","[('Cable Tv', 'ORG'), ('AMC FX FXX', 'ORG'), ('Cable Card Tuner', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('up to 6', 'CARDINAL'), ('NAS', 'ORG'), ('5', 'CARDINAL'), ('NAS', 'ORG'), ('USB', 'ORG'), ('NASThen', 'PERSON'), ('Windows 7', 'PRODUCT'), ('Windows Media Center', 'ORG'), ('Family Guy', 'PRODUCT'), ('The Simpsons you', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('ten + years', 'DATE'), ('just a couple months', 'DATE'), ('rerun.&#x200B;I', 'ORG'), ('25000', 'CARDINAL'), ('Antenna Tuner', 'PERSON'), ('15', 'MONEY'), ('4', 'CARDINAL'), ('100', 'MONEY'), ('Antenna', 'PRODUCT'), ('3am in the morning', 'TIME'), ('Antenna Tuner', 'PERSON'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('4', 'CARDINAL'), ('Ceton Cable Card', 'ORG'), ('NAS', 'ORG'), ('four', 'CARDINAL'), ('5', 'CARDINAL'), ('friday', 'DATE'), ('sales&#x200B;I', 'PERSON'), ('720', 'CARDINAL'), ('HVEC', 'ORG'), ('1080', 'DATE'), ('40inch', 'CARDINAL'), ('8 feet', 'QUANTITY'), ('NAS', 'ORG'), ('Android Box', 'PERSON'), ('5', 'CARDINAL'), ('NAS', 'ORG'), ('6', 'CARDINAL'), ('8', 'CARDINAL'), ('5', 'CARDINAL'), ('year', 'DATE'), ('6 months', 'DATE'), ('about 300', 'CARDINAL'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('DC', 'PERSON'), ('32,455', 'CARDINAL'), ('007', 'CARDINAL'), ('B&W', 'ORG'), ('Westerns', 'ORG'), ('KungFu', 'ORG'), ('Jeanie', 'GPE'), ('Netflix', 'PERSON'), ('HBO', 'ORG'), ('ESPN', 'ORG'), ('DRM Encryption', 'PRODUCT')]"

The Tablo works with almost any streaming media device (roku, amazon stick, chromecast, android tv, etc etc).  As an alternative that I sometimes wish I would have done, you can go with Plex and a HDHomerun DVR.  It's similar, but not exactly the same.  Plex has more features and can integrate your OTA content with your home media (if you have a media NAS, for example) into a single app.  However, I find Tablo to be an easier-to-use app for watching content (simple tv controls are better/easier and more visually pleasing).

Three weeks later they offered to reinstate me for half the cost, $300 in debit cards, and forgive my $350 final bill (two months I owed them.)  I'm back at $60 instead of $145 (but at a lower package.)  A few odd things.  First, retentions chastise me for not calling to get bill credits which according to her customers are always eligible for, so I asked for one and the best she could do was $10 and lower my package to save money.  Second, after canceling me she said ""If you change your mind and want to come back, we have some very attractive promos you can qualify for.""  I asked her, ""Why not just offer those to me now so I don't have to cancel and resubscribe?"" and her answer was vaguely that she doesn't have the ability to do that.  Later I come to find out that retentions doesn't have access to deals that the ""win back"" department does (which is essentially like new subscriber promos.)  This is so backasswards.  Instead of just lower my bill to keep a loyal customer, they took back all of their equipment, rolled truck out to install all new equipment, and ate about $650 in cash in addition to $45 in bill credits for 1 year  All I wanted was to get my $145 bill down to $70 (including lowering my package) which would have amounted to about $40 in discounts.

I have an HD Homerun and it actually lets you do a 2 minute preview of the streaming channels. Based upon that (and other online comments), I can tell you that the streaming quality is not particularly good. The other day I flipped between Avengers streaming on USA Network on the HD Homerun and YouTube TV. I can’t cite exact resolutions, frame rate or bit rate, but the YTTV image was clearly superior. HDHR looked much more compressed, grainy, etc. It was disappointing because the primary appeal of the HDHR is getting the high quality antenna feed for local networks. But there’s little value in trading slightly improved PQ on 5-6 stations for poorer quality on dozens of others. Also they only carry one feed (east vs west) for most streaming channels. One that comes immediately to mind is Paramount Network (Spike.) I live in the east but they only carry the west coast feed.

Pick a weak station on your tvfool report to do this.. the strong ones you won't have problems with.&#x200B;Ok so it works and you get good signal.. now your home's wiring.If a splitter is used anywhere on the line from the injector to the antenna it will block the voltage getting to the antenna..

Its a good way to know your amp is dead if you get no signal .. but your amp is probably not dead.a bad wire .. a bad crimp on a wire.. that can cause problemsI bought a Channel Master Preamp that came with a cable but the cable wasn't crimped correctly .. it was the small inserter cable from the power supply to the inserter.. so I replaced that and it worked fine.so idk if i missed anything.. and others have touched on other things&#x200B;good luck,"[('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Next', 'ORG'), ('DC/IR', 'ORG'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('purchase)[https://www.hfqpdb.com', 'ORG'), ('between 12 and 18volts DC..', 'CARDINAL'), ('things&#x200B;good', 'GPE')]"

4896,"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?","Yes, the lag time be greatly reduced if you use the HD Homerun client app.You don't have as many features with the HDHR app, though, so you may want to use some other software such as Emby or Plex. I've been using Emby and like it so far.What's going to impact your speed the most is whether or not your set-up needs to transcode the live feed. One of the reasons why Tablo is so slow is that it transcodes everything. An HDTV over-the-air broadcast comes in over the coax at 21mbps in mpeg format. Tablo can't simply resend what it's receiving natively, it transcodes all of it first to a smaller bit rate (8mbps, I believe).Because you're leaving Tablo to speed things up, you need to make sure the solution you implement doesn't require everything to be transcoded or else you're not going to be a whole lot better off.  A good solution I've found is using a 4 Tuner HDHR with Emby running on an Intel QuickSync capable CPU with Amazon Fire TV boxes as the clients at each TV.  Unlike Roku, the Amazon Fire can natively handle mpeg, which is great bc this allows the broadcast to come in through the HDHR and get routed through Emby in it's native format with no transcoding. It's extremely quick and of course the picture quality is perfect.Transcoding is a terrible thing for live broadcast OTA television inside a house. It slows everything down, you lose the original broadcast quality and it's ridiculous when you could just plug the coax directly into a television and get perfect quality quickly. Tablo really needs to implement some type of non-transcoding solution for inside a home network or at least some type of pass through to a nearby television. 90% of your live TV viewing will be in your home and it's just a dumb solution to require all of it to be transcoded and compressed down to a smaller size.Transcoding has its place, though. If you want to watch live TV outside your home network then it will have to be transcoded if your upload speed from your home network is less than 21mbps. Also, if you are watching your TV on a cellphone on your carrier's data plan then you don't want to chew up a whole month's data cap watching streaming TV @ 21mbps on a small screen where you can't even tell the difference between that and 4mbps. Emby is very easy to set up and you can force it to transcode only those streams you play outside of your home network. I have Emby set to transcode any of those streams down to 4mbps before sending them over the internet to my phone. You also probably want to use transcoding for the things you record to save space and facilitate easier playback later whether at home or on the road. For those use-cases you'll want to have a server that can get its hardware involved to help with the transcoding process. Intel CPUs that have QuickSync can do hardware transcoding. With only a 2 tuners going, an Intel Dual Core i5 QuickSync CPU should be adequate. But with a 4-tuner set-up I would recommend more power. Also, using a SSD to do the transcoding and run Emby is recommended although I'm just using a regular old laptop drive.","[('Homerun', 'PERSON'), ('HDHR', 'ORG'), ('Emby', 'GPE'), ('Plex', 'GPE'), ('Emby', 'GPE'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('Tablo', 'PERSON'), ('21mbps', 'CARDINAL'), ('Tablo', 'PERSON'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Tablo', 'PERSON'), ('4', 'CARDINAL'), ('Emby', 'PERSON'), ('Intel', 'ORG'), ('QuickSync', 'PRODUCT'), ('Amazon Fire TV', 'ORG'), ('Roku', 'GPE'), ('Amazon Fire', 'FAC'), ('HDHR', 'ORG'), ('Emby', 'GPE'), ('Tablo', 'PERSON'), ('90%', 'PERCENT'), ('less than 21mbps', 'CARDINAL'), (""a whole month's"", 'DATE'), ('21mbps', 'CARDINAL'), ('4mbps', 'CARDINAL'), ('Emby', 'PERSON'), ('Emby', 'PERSON'), ('4mbps', 'CARDINAL'), ('Intel', 'ORG'), ('QuickSync', 'ORG'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('Intel', 'ORG'), ('4-tuner', 'CARDINAL'), ('SSD', 'ORG'), ('Emby', 'PERSON')]"

Plan was to get that sweet GF hooked up the following month. Long story short, I went a year without TV and home internet. Spent more time out of the house, and didn’t miss a thing. Saw some great bands, learned to two step, went on a lot of dates, and ended up meeting a great girl that I’m now engaged to. GF eventually came, and I enjoyed about three months of it at that place before moving out. The Fiancé and I live in a GF house.

Both of those services are missing some channels you may want, but Philo is a good gap filler for just $16 per month. Directv Now may have the single best picture quality (by a narrow margin.)

They offer the option to purchase a third stream and will soon offer paid DVR tier. But if you’re getting in at the tier with Regional Sports Networks, you’re already facing a $55 per month bill before add-ons.With Sling, I was never impressed with the app or the streaming quality. Their small add-on packages are unique and may save money depending on your viewing habits. Or it could cost you just as much as any other service if you need channels from both Orange + Blue, sports add-on, lifestyle add-on, etc. Also note Disney/ESPN networks cannot be recorded and you can only stream to one device at a time.

5525,New Research Shows We’re Now at Peak OTT,"> Showtime had the highest churn rate, which means bringing in consumers before they leave, among providers, according to the analysis, and Netflix had the lowest. Showtime’s churn rate was more than 95 percent, while Netflix had a rate of less than 10 percent, according to the research.This might explain two things... Showtime’s recent $4.99 3-month summer sale and the forthcoming increase to $10.99 from $8.99. From a consumer standpoint, there’s beauty in not having to subscribe every month if you choose not to. And the services need to take that into account and rethink how and when they program their series to help decrease the churn rate. Unfortunately they still plan programming for a linear audience.

5597,"Router, Modem or Provider?","I’ve been having issues lately on the 5GHz spectrum and quickly identified the issue being the other WiFi networks around me.  I live in an apartment and many years ago noticed the 2.4GHz spectrum was jam packed with routers owned by neighbors.  At that time (Oct 2012), I was the ONLY person with a 5GHz SSID. Never had an issue until this past month. Now almost all the 5GHz channels are occupied by neighbors with newer equipment from their ISPs. When my network starts having issues, I use the Speedtest app on my phone to verify I’m experiencing a device wide endpoint issue and not an “app” issue when I notice a slowdown. Then I use an iOS app called Fing to determine wether or not I can hit the router from the endpoint, and most importantly, the latency. When all is well, 2-3ms is the latency. When there’s an issue pertaining to RF interference on my WiFi channel, the latency is MUCH higher. When I see a high ping to the router, I fire up a PC and launch a program called INSSIDER to identify the SSID and channels of the networks around me. 100% of the time I get a high ping to the router with Fing, I will find that a neighbor’s 5GHz WiFi Network has landed on my channel.

5604,Amazon Prime Video Data High Usage,"Amazon says that 4K streaming requires at least a 15 Mbps connection. Streaming at exactly 15 Mbps for 1 hour comes to 6.75 GB, so the ""about 6.84 GB per hour"" estimate you're seeing on your laptop is probably for 4K video. Amazon recommends at least 3.5 Mbps connection for 720p HD video, which comes to about 1.5 GB per hour. Double that to about 3 GB per hour for 1080p.Of course, this can vary greatly depending on what you're watching because the streams use a variable bitrate, not a fixed bitrate. Videos with many small and fast moving components, like rain, will use a lot more bandwidth than videos with many static images, like a space documentary. The values of 1.5 GB, 3 GB, and 6.75 GB per hour for 720p, 1080p, and 4K are likely the minimum amounts to expect, since those values correlate to the lowest connection requirements for each stream quality.If you're concerned about bandwidth usage, be sure you're using a streaming device that supports HEVC H.265 video decoding. Such a device will consume less bandwidth than an older device that only supports H.264, while producing the same image quality.The current (2nd-gen) [Fire TV Stick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZV9RDKK/) is a good option for a low-cost HEVC H.265 device. Amazon also added new [quality settings](http://www.aftvnews.com/you-can-now-select-from-3-video-quality-settings-on-the-amazon-fire-tv-and-fire-tv-stick/) and [bandwidth monitoring](http://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-can-now-monitor-data-usage-and-alert-you-when-youve-reached-a-data-cap/) last year to all Fire TV models. They let you reduce the quality setting from ""Best"" to ""Better"" which will reduce the bandwidth usage by almost half without affecting the image quality much. You can drop the quality to ""Good"" for a 90% reduction in bandwidth usage, but the image is noticeably worse. You can also set a bandwidth limit in the OS so that it warns you, or even cuts you off, when you exceed a certain amount. You can also set what day of the month your billing cycle resets, so that the bandwidth tracker automatically resets.","[('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('4', 'CARDINAL'), ('15', 'CARDINAL'), ('Mbps', 'PERSON'), ('15', 'CARDINAL'), ('Mbps for 1 hour', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('6.75 GB', 'MONEY'), ('about 6.84', 'CARDINAL'), ('GB per hour', 'TIME'), ('4', 'CARDINAL'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('at least 3.5', 'CARDINAL'), ('Mbps', 'PERSON'), ('720p', 'CARDINAL'), ('about 1.5', 'CARDINAL'), ('GB per hour', 'TIME'), ('about 3', 'CARDINAL'), ('GB per hour for 1080p', 'TIME'), ('Videos', 'GPE'), ('1.5', 'CARDINAL'), ('GB', 'GPE'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('GB', 'GPE'), ('6.75 GB', 'MONEY'), ('720p', 'DATE'), ('1080p', 'DATE'), ('4', 'CARDINAL'), ('HEVC', 'ORG'), ('2nd', 'ORDINAL'), ('B00ZV9RDKK/', 'ORG'), ('HEVC', 'ORG'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('almost half', 'CARDINAL'), ('90%', 'PERCENT'), ('bandwidth usage', 'DATE'), ('OS', 'ORG'), ('day of the month', 'DATE')]"

The French in particular tend to be very *particular* when it comes to cultural content, especially movies, hence why this does not surprise me at all.Note the following:1. The ""law"" is not a law yet; it was proposed by the European Commission (*essentially the ""cabinet""/executive branch of the EU*) and has yet to be passed by the legislature (*The European Parliament, essentially the House of Representatives in U.S. speak*). The Commission thinks this may be a formality though, and they might be right. The most ""classically liberal"" country is in a secessiony situation which means the others are less likely to get back a more free-market approach, and they may want more ""aid"" for their services too.

Are you planning on allowing remote DVR access? If yes, you can specify the data size you allow for remote streaming (remote meaning you’re watching Live TV or DVR recordings while away from home). If you’re only going to be watching OTA channels while you’re home, I guess you’ll only need to worry about the throughput of your router.

Never believe you understand all factors involved.Perform your calculations as best you can, select the antenna which should work, then hook it up. If it doesn't deliver, take the gamble of adding a 30db amplifier. Such amplifiers are notorious for their instability and lack of overload headroom....but your case might be different. That roof/shingle system might have a loss of 30db - so all you are doing is putting things back the way they wuz.The equivalent circuit of an attic based antenna is a roof/shingle loss device (attenuator) ahead of your antenna. The loss device should reduce RF noise along with that signal...so your amplifier may NOT turn things into a noisy mess.https://www.channelmaster.com/TV_Antenna_Preamplifier_p/cm-7777.htmYour install is ""an original"".

If your house in on the top of a hill then it might not make much difference but most people will end up clearing a lot of obstructions if they go beyond roof height. Also, the building materials the roof is made from will block signals to some extent. One rule of thumb is that it will reduce your signal strength by about half.Here are some appropriate antennas for either the attic or the roof:* Winegard HD7694P* Channel Master CM-2018... pointed a bit south of due east before any further adjustment...Ref: https://www.rabbitears.info/market.php?mktid=35","[('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('about half', 'CARDINAL'), ('Channel Master CM-2018', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Ref', 'PERSON')]"

6260,Cord-Cutting: 71% Of U.S. Consumers Remain Loyal To The Cord,"I cut the cord on cable TV about 3 months ago. I had a lot of reservations because I have non-technical people in my family that don't want to have to think about things too much to sit down and watch TV. I also initially thought that the sports would be a problem, and that the cost savings weren't really there. I am on Spectrum (formerly Time Warner) and was getting a triple play package or whatever it is called (Cable, Phone, TV). I had two cable boxes and the cable tv part of my bill was around $100. I was getting mixed messages from how much I'd save when talking to customer service. A $5 price increase was the last straw so I began my journey into cutting the cord. Since my family doesn't watch TV much, the $100 cost was not worth it and everyone was OK with us trying out something different as long as our main channels were there.It took me a couple of days two narrow down to DirectTV Now or Youtube TV. I got the Apple TV for around $100 by signing up for 3 months of DirectTV now. I ended up canceling it and going with Youtube TV, because they had more channels that I watch, a great UI, and I like the DVR functionality. Direct TV Now didn't get local channels in my area, so that was a non-starter for me (I want local channels all on the same input without having to buy more devices or antennas). My current cable bill (Internet and Phone only) is $80 less after cutting my DVR and cable channels. Adding Youtube TV cost me $40 a month. So my net savings is around $40 a month and I have all the channels I need. I have a few other TV's and have Xboxes on those. The Youtube TV app on Xbox is really good. I also just recently bought a Roku Streaming + stick and spent $55 on it so I could watch football games down on my basement TV. As of now, I'm near break even for savings. I don't anticipate having to buy anything else for a while.I really like streaming, and won't ever go back to cable, but I do understand why people want to stick with it for now. Cable TV is indeed comfortable and easy. You don't need to do research, and it mostly ""just works"". You don't need to buy another device, add a new remote and input to toggle, or worry about device compatibility with your streaming service (in my case, I found out my Amazon Fire Stick wasn't compatible with Youtube TV). The problem I see with cable is the continued price increases, which are exacerbated by people cutting the cord- they are spreading the licensing fees to a declining customer base.Until someone produces a relatively inexpensive device that combines all services (local channels, other channels, streaming apps, etc.) and DVR capability into a super simple device, I don't see people leaving in droves. Unfortunately, there are a lot of problems with having something like this, because of all the licensing and content issues. You also need it to scale cheaply/efficiently to several TV's, and be SIMPLE to use and setup. Plex TV is probably the closest thing I know to this, but it requires an HD antenna, tuner, media server/hardware, DVR software setup, etc. Costs add up quickly and the complexity will limit broader adoption.

6450,Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"I used Hulu when they first started up (2007 I think?). At first they were selling themselves as 'not like cable - no commercials!' And it was great. Obviously, that couldn't last so they added a commercial at the beginning of a video. Fine, OK. Then they went to multiple ad breaks of one ad during a video, and they said that would be it. *sigh* OK, it's still better than cable. Then they added the paid subscription which was supposed to be ad-free (after previously saying that the service would always be free). At the same time the ad breaks went from one to minimum of three ads during a break. The ads went from 5-10 seconds long to 30+. Then the paid subscription had ads too, just fewer of them (for a time there was no ad-free option).All of this progressed over a period of about two years, with constant promises that the advertising levels would not be increased which would then be broken in a month or two. The constant devolvement of the quality of the service got tiresome and started to look malicious. Basically, they created a user base and then started exploiting them as greedily as they felt they could get away with. Personally, that kind of behavior pushed me away from the service. Netflix never treated their customer base in such a way.","[('Hulu', 'GPE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('2007', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('5-10 seconds', 'TIME'), ('30', 'CARDINAL'), ('about two years', 'DATE'), ('month', 'DATE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Netflix', 'PERSON')]"

I won’t say everything is awesome but I’ve gotten immersed in many series and movies from them. Even some of the foreign series have been great, like Dark, I just use the CC option. To be honest I keep that on all the time now even for English shows/movies. Some of them can have some strong accents that make having it on nice to know for sure what was said otherwise I can easily ignore it. I’ll admit that finding something new to watch can be daunting because 1. There is so much I see that I may like and 2. The different genre selections and menu set up make it hard to search and don’t even show you everything they have available, it’s based off each profile.

6653,Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"This was a concern of mine when I cut the cord and so far it's working out fine. I've never exceeded my data cap in the year or so I've been cable free.I'm a gamer too and while I've typically always opted for physical copies anyway, I do like to download the Games with Gold and PS+ games every month which add up fast. I won't lie to you, you're going to have to exercise some restraint and planning when it comes to your game downloads and streaming time. 1TB a month is manageable but, like you said, it's still easy to go over if you're not careful.I'm currently using Directv Now which, from what I understand, is the biggest data hog of the streaming services although I think Vue is not far behind (just the price you pay for that sweet sweet PQ). Depending on the month you're looking at about 33GB a day. I would just do a trial of Vue and don't even turn on the cable box for that week. Only use Vue and the other streaming services you typically use and then track how much you're using each day over the course of that free trial and extrapolate that over a month's time. It should give you a decent idea of how close to the cap you'll get and whether or not you need to take steps to reduce your data usage. We've had to be better about turning streams off when we leave the room, or switching over to antennae if we just want background noise. Online gaming doesn't really use much data, it's your girlfriend's netflix/hulu and the tv watching you guys do that's going to chip away at that cap fast. And of course you'll need to plan out your game downloads accordingly. If I know I'm not going to have a chance to play the game any time soon I'll hold off til later in the week when I can consciously make sure I'm shoring up some data over those few days to download it later on.Like I said, it's going to require a bit of a lifestyle change, and honestly there's a bit of added stress monitoring your data usage every month.

6659,Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"We're a family of 4 w/ a 1TB data cap and were on PSVue for years.  It's pretty tricky to avoid hitting a cap with that many people all online and it's not just PSVue.  Netflix and software updates and gaming all take their toll. That said, I think you two will be just fine. It gets a little trickier as the size of the household increases, though. If you're still concerned, then there are some things that will help manage your data limit:1. If you have a wireless phone plan that includes unlimited data, then USE IT! You're paying for it. This takes some of the burden off your home internet.  Only 3 of us are old enough to have phones, but we got on the TMobile One Plus plan back when they had a crazy promotion going on and we have 3 lines of ""unlimited"" (throttled after 50GB/user each month) for a combined total of only $80/mo., taxes included.  We have a rule that there is no connecting to wi-fi in the house.  I estimate we probably conserve about 100GB/mo of our home internet data limit by making sure our phones do everything over LTE.2. I just installed Windows 10 last night so I thought I'd point out that by default it is set up to use your internet connection as a P2P server to help others download windows updates.  That is a big no-no if you're on a data cap so be sure to turn it off.  We have 4 computers in the home I'm in the process of updating to Windows 10 so that could easily kill our 1TB data cap.  In fact, I also recommend changing the auto-update settings so that it doesn't automatically check/download any updates without you doing it manually. There are a ton of settings in Windows 10 you should probably also turn off if you want to conserve bandwidth.3. I haven't tried it yet, but there is an open-source router firmware you can flash to certain compatible routers called *Gargoyle* that will allow you to set data quotas for devices.  You can make them daily quotas, you can set times when they just can't connect at all, you can set monthly quotas, etc... If you have a device you're worried about eating up too much data, you can limit it through the router.  Maybe you don't want your Roku/FireTV streaming box to use up more than 400GB in a month -- you can make sure it gets cut off when that happens. Or, you can even set the router to limit the max throughput to the device which will force Youtube/Netflix/Etc... to stream at a lower resolution which will conserve more bandwidth. You could maybe also set up another rule that limits your gaming device to 400GB and then give each of your computers a 75GB/mo limit which will leave 50GB available for emergencies and other less demanding devices to access.  I've heard that you can also upload a custom hosts file to the router that will block, at the router, advertising sites so that when you are on the web you aren't wasting precious bandwidth.","[('4', 'CARDINAL'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('PSVue', 'ORG'), ('years', 'DATE'), ('PSVue', 'ORG'), ('Netflix', 'PERSON'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Only 3', 'CARDINAL'), ('the TMobile One Plus', 'EVENT'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('50GB', 'CARDINAL'), ('only $80/mo', 'MONEY'), ('100GB/mo', 'ORG'), ('LTE.2', 'GPE'), ('Windows 10 last night', 'TIME'), ('4', 'CARDINAL'), ('Windows 10', 'PRODUCT'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('Windows 10', 'PRODUCT'), ('Gargoyle', 'ORG'), ('daily', 'DATE'), ('monthly', 'DATE'), ('more than 400', 'CARDINAL'), ('a month', 'DATE'), ('Youtube', 'PERSON'), ('Netflix', 'PERSON'), ('400', 'CARDINAL'), ('GB', 'GPE'), ('75GB', 'CARDINAL'), ('50GB', 'QUANTITY')]"

Other streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime force you now to make an account with them directly and in the case of Netflix no longer accept subscriptions through the playstore.

It takes some planning and careful layout, but it's not hard, nor is it overly expensive. At WXIA-TV, my other job, we take direct lightning strikes nearly every time there's a thunderstorm. Our downtime from such strikes is almost non-existant.  The last time we went down from a strike, it was due to a strike on the power company's lines knocking *them* out, ...> The keys to effective lightning protection are surprisingly simple, and surprisingly less than obvious. Of course you *must* have a single point ground system that eliminates all ground loops. And you must present a low *impedance* path for the energy to go. That's most generally a low *inductance* path rather than just a low ohm DC path.Or a case study on how Orange Count FL stopped having damage from lightning:http://www.psihq.com/AllCopper.htmIn 2002 earthing was upgraded which ended future damage.Lightning is only capricious when one foolishly assumes protectors do protection.

An in-line coax protector does nothing for protection if not connected low impedance (ie less than 10 feet) to single point earth ground.  Plug-in protectors can make surge damage easier.Damage from a surge is directly traceable to human mistakes.  Apparently plenty were made.  Some are listed above.Lightning is not capricious as so many only assume - because so many did not even know of the so many mistakes listed in that first paragraph.Lightning blew right through a protector?  That classic fable is promoted by the naive to the uneducated.  Nothing 'blocks' a surge.  Anyone (anything) that tries to is drinking the kool-aid.  Do you really think an in-line protector will block what three miles of sky cannot? Do you really believe hundreds or thousand (near zero) joules in a magic plug-in strip does anything useful for surges (that can be hundreds of thousands of joules)? Protection from direct lightning strikes is routine in every town.  Your telco CO suffers about 100 surges with each storm.  Ecery town still has phone service during and four days after every storm.  Simple protection is that effective.  They don't foolishly try to block a surge.  They do not waste money on adjacent, plug-in magic boxes.  And do not listen to the so many manipulated naive who claim nothing can avert lightning damage.A cited cordcutter.com text only introduces ""why it is important to ground an outdoor  antenna"".  Apparently the installation even violated those simple concepts.Effective protection always answers this question.  Where do hundreds of thousands of joules harmlessly dissipate.  Once a surge is anywhere inside a structure, then what only remains is is robust protection already inside appliances.  And that can be compromised is a plug-in protector is anywhere nearby.  If a surge is so massive as to even blow through best protection inside appliances, then a human has made some serious mistakes (some already listed).  A protector is only as effective as its low impedance, hardwire (ie not inside metallic conduit, no sharp wire bends, etc) connection to and quality of single point earth ground.  All other grounds (wall receptacle, digital, virtual, chassis, analog, floating, anti-static, etc) are irrelevant.

6986,How do you guys have your antenna grounded?,"> Some say that properly grounding antennas may reduce the chances of a strike because it neutralizes static electricity build up that attracts ""feelers""That concept is called ESE.  ESE manufacturers wanted their products listed in codes as Article 781. It was roundly rejected for good reason.  Rather then do research to prove such protectors are effective, instead, in 1998 they sued using expensive lawyers to intimidate the NFPA.  So the NFPA did a study (see Bryan Panel) that basically said the entire concept is bogus.  And that ESE manufacturer should first prove their devices in research studies.Never happened.  Myth about discharging static to prevent lightning lives on with other fables and urban myths.Routine are direct lightning strikes without damage. But that means a transient current must find a best path to earth without being anywhere inside.  Effective protection without damage even to a protector has been routine for well over 100 years.  Based in the same concepts demonstrated by Franklin over 250 years ago.  Effective protection is that well proven.  And, unfortunately, unknown to a majority of consumers.MOVs have excessive capacitance; cannot be used on RF circuits.  A consumer must read specification number for a coax protector.  It should be 1 Ghz or higher - depending on its application.

7228,Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,"I have a Stream+ and a HDhomerun Duo. The Stream+ is pretty good. You can side load both Netflix and Prime. Netflix took over a year to approve the same device used in Australia by Foxtel for streaming only; they have changed how freely they give their streaming rights out now that they are dominant in the market. There is an active beta group for Google Live Channels and there is the promise to reveal the full 14 day guide (right now it's there, but you can only see 48 hours). The main disadvantage is you cannot start to record a program and then start watching the recording in delay mode (""chase play""). You can also use the HDhomerun app as a channel input so the channels are integrated with your other sources like Pluto TV.Some people are using the hard drive attached to the S+  as the storage for the HDHR $35 a year DVR.

As I understand the way Live Channels works on the Stream+ you can also just get your OTA channels directly on the Stream+ and integrate the same channels into the Live Channels guide with PlutoTV, too? I think I'm missing something.>Amazon is rumored to have a OTA DVR coming that is code named Frank. Maybe they will get it right.I read a leak about that recently. If Amazon uses their leverage to get some agreements from various streaming television providers to allow their guides to be fully integrated into a single channel program guide that includes all the OTA channels (if someone subscribes to one of those providers) and creates a device with at least 2 tuners and the ability to pair multiple devices together then they could hit a home-run.  They have the ability, I'm just concerned their interest is mostly in selling videos and their own season-pass subscriptions. I am anxious to see what they come up with, though.  A little off-topic, but I'd like to see a DVR maker with clout follow Sling's lead with a more agnostic and open framework and pressure all the streaming providers to make their guides available for integration based on what their subscribers are receiving. Sling is really on track with the AirTV/AirTV Player concept.  They're the first streaming service provider to have integrated their channel guide with anything else at all. Integrating over-the-air free channels from antennas with their own streaming service, inside the same grid-based channel guide, has taken far too long. No one wants to switch back and forth from a ""OTA channels app"" to a ""SlingTV app"" anytime they want to go between seeing what's on AMC and what's on their local PBS affiliate or sub-channels. It shouldn't make a difference whether we are getting our channels from a streaming service provider or an antenna -- they should just all be placed inside a single program guide with 14-day program data and DVR ability regardless. I wish more providers had followed Google's lead with the Live Channels option that they made available. It's there just waiting to be used by any provider that wants to do the same thing.I read the other day that it costs a cable provider between $10-$15/mo for ever single subscriber just to pay the ""re-transmission fees"" to give their subscribers the local over the air stations that are floating around in the air for free.

7240,Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,"Yes, I can see that. I had just about forgotten that the majority of their business was from paying cable subscribers.  I could see them having a smaller business going forward in the OTA/Antenna market that likes to supplement their antenna some parts of the year with cable streaming services like Sling.  The new Roamio VOX OTA 1TB is pretty darn close to a perfect device for people who have ditched cable. They're for sale right now for $349 w/ Lifetime guide data, includes voice remote, antenna hookup, has Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Youtube, Vudu, Pandora, HBO, Hulu (regular, not Live), and some other apps.  Sadly, though, without a SlingTV or other cable streaming app it isn't quite perfect.  It's also pretty expensive if you need it on more than 1 TV.  That requires buying a mini Vox for $180/TV which is like buying an nVidia Shield for every TV. For only 1 TV though, it's a great solution that's *almost* perfect.All of these devices with built-in tuners, including Tivo, are going to be obsolete in a few years once ATSC 3.0 begins rolling out nationally.  They will be usable for a maximum of 5 years after the national roll-out since stations will be required to continue broadcasting in ATSC 2.0, but it's still borrowed time. That's probably the most appealing thing about going with a Tablo. The hardware will be obsolete and abandoned the same time as all the Tivos, but *if* Tablo is still around and *if* DVRs are even a thing after ATSC 3.0 (which allows broadcasters to encode a no-record code if they want) then the lifetime subscription paid to Tablo will follow a person when they purchase a new device.","[('Antenna', 'PERSON'), ('the year', 'DATE'), ('Sling', 'ORG'), ('Roamio VOX', 'PERSON'), ('OTA 1TB', 'ORG'), ('349', 'MONEY'), ('Lifetime', 'ORG'), ('Netflix', 'PERSON'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Video', 'ORG'), ('Youtube', 'ORG'), ('Vudu', 'PERSON'), ('Pandora', 'ORG'), ('HBO', 'ORG'), ('Hulu', 'GPE'), ('SlingTV', 'ORG'), ('more than 1', 'CARDINAL'), ('Vox', 'PERSON'), ('180/TV', 'MONEY'), ('nVidia Shield', 'ORG'), ('only 1 TV', 'CARDINAL'), ('Tivo', 'PERSON'), ('a few years', 'DATE'), ('ATSC', 'ORG'), ('3.0', 'CARDINAL'), ('5 years', 'DATE'), ('2.0', 'CARDINAL'), ('Tablo', 'ORG'), ('Tivos', 'GPE'), ('Tablo', 'PERSON'), ('Tablo', 'ORG')]"

Omnis can work and they're common in RV applications, but they're not as good as a quality directional antenna.Personally, I would first try a directional high-gain antenna pointed at the majority of the stations and I wouldn't even think about a pre-amp until everything else failed and you don't have to buy an antenna that has one already in it you can always ad one in-line later if needed. You may be surprised at what you'll pick up with a good directional antenna. I was shocked to run a channel scan and find out I was getting ALL of the channels that were behind and to the side of my roof-mounted directional antenna at nearly full-strength! [I got the RCA Yagi](https://www.amazon.com/RCA-Compact-Outdoor-Antenna-Range/dp/B0024R4B5C).Once you've tried a directional antenna, then, if there are still a few more off in another direction that you need to grab, just buy another directional antenna and mount it to the same mast, but point it the other direction toward the other stations.  Then all you have to do is take a bi-directional 2-way splitter (also called a combiner) and install it backwards so that the coax from each antenna is going into each of the ""out"" ports and the main trunk to your home is going out of the ""in"" port.  When you install the antennas on the mast, just try to keep about 4' between them so that one is 4ft higher than the other.","[('First', 'ORDINAL'), ('more than 1', 'CARDINAL'), ('Second', 'ORDINAL'), ('Omnis', 'PERSON'), ('RV', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('RCA', 'ORG'), ('Yagi](https://www.amazon.com/RCA-Compact-Outdoor-Antenna-Range', 'PRODUCT'), ('2-way splitter', 'QUANTITY'), ('about 4', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('4', 'CARDINAL')]"

7454,I have 98GB left. Afraid I'll go over my cap. Help?,"The month I did a trial for DTVN, i had the highest data usage I have ever had even compared to extensive binge-watching on Netflix and Hulu. I am sure it is worse with multiple users.  Here are some suggestions. YMMV.1. Make sure that you completely log out of any apps/channels on any streaming device. (Note that they will update whenever they are on too so you may want to unplug them. Don't shut off the tv while in the app or channel, exit it to the home screen for the device. 2. Don't watch 4K video. Don't download large files or large game purchases. Not sure if gaming uses alot of data, but my guess is that it probably uses more than you think.3. Live streaming services use more data than Netflix and probably Hulu. Avoid using them for the rest of the month. Use an antenna, watch DVDs from the library.4. Don't leave streaming services on if you aren't actually watching them. Don't fall asleep to them. Antenna is a better choice. Remember that streaming music also uses data.5. Try QoS on your router.6. Some services do allow you to set the video quality especially on mobile devices. Live streaming services typically don't.7.

7528,"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","I hate hate and hate posts like this. First of all, they never ever factor in that either way, the OP is paying for internet. Nor do they factor in the taxes, rental fees especially for multiple tvs, broadcast and sports fees and other miscellaneous charges. They also don't factor in many cable tv subscribers still subscribe to Netflix or Hulu or Amazon Prime. They don't count those in but they do count them on the cordcutter side. Secondly they assume that people want live tv and that they want to recreate cable tv. They also assume people would sign up for everything and also never cancel any service. Especially for channels like HBO, many people only subscribe for less than 6 months a year. They never consider the non-promotional rates. I have been with Comcast a long time, I don't qualify for promo rates. But I don't have a contract and I don't have any ETF to worry about. I cut the cord about seven years ago. I did not have any new subscriber promo pricing at the time - just double internet+tv package. When I cut, I had Performance + basic limited cable tv packages and rented a cable box for a then standard definition tv. It was about $79 to $87 approximately counting fees and taxes. I had no DVR, no on demand, and about eight to 10 channels. Basically I cut the cord because every time Comcast, pushed a group of favorite channels up to a more expensive tier, I had no reason to pay for the existing tier and dropped to a lower one. The first group to go was the then Sci-fi channel (now SyFy). Basic cable tv was frustrating and limited. I got more shopping, Spanish, and religion channels than anything else. I had to pay a fee for sports even though I didn't have ESPN. I had to pay to rent a box. I had taxes. To supplement it, I had to get the Netflix DVD and then later the Netflix streaming service and Hulu. These were each about $8 a piece then. (I have had Prime but I don't think I did before i cut the cord.)  I found I was using these more than the TV. I eventually ran out of tv tiers to cut and the fees were jacked up about another $15 so I cut the cord and dropped down to Performance Starter which was 6/1 then. I still have Performance Starter which is now 15/2. (Not upgrading since they don't sell 25/5 here). The price has gone up a bit I think in seven years but all internet plans have.I value on demand more than live tv. I have absolutely no interest in recreating the cable tv I had. If I were to, it would consist of an antenna, some roku channels for shopping and religion and the CSPAN website because literally that is what I had. And I am more interested in shows not channels so recreating something others had doesn't really make sense to me. Currently:* Internet: I pay $49.99 (non promo rate) for Performance Starter and $0 for taxes. I own my own modem so no rental fees.(I would still pay for internet but I wouldn't be allowed to keep this plan, i would have to pay for a more expensive faster plan). I have no data cap but even if I did, I use nowhere near most data caps. * Hulu: My plan is $7.99 but my $5.99 promo rate was just renewed. No taxes. * CBS All Access: I currently am not subscribed but when I do sign up again for the winter it will be $5.99. I rotate between services because some like CBS don't have new episodes in the summer. This is something I cannot do with cable tv. * Antenna. Free to watch. i paid about $35 for the Winegard Flatwave antenna about 5 or so years ago. I currently get over 25 channels or sub-channels although I probably only watch about 6 or 7 regularly. I don't use a DVR.* Hoopla Digital, Vudu Movies on Us, TubiTV, Roku Channel, NewsON, PBS, CBS News, YouTube, etc. Tons of movies and shows and videos. The DVD collection at my public library.

Since going all-in with streaming, I haven't had anything blacked out, haven't been impacted by an outage, have had all my local channels and have unlimited DVR. Obviously, some of that depends on where you live, but my experience with YouTube TV as a heavy live sports watcher has been excellent.It seems like pretty much everyone who shares a post like this original poster's really wants to get away from the cable/satellite model: lease hardware from the cable/satellite company, hope it doesn't crap out after a year, pay a monthly fee for the right to use DVR, see mysterious fees all over your bill, deal with equipment and/or cancellation fees, receive terrible customer service like clockwork. Streaming a great alternative and you really don't give up much, if anything.Streaming, at the very least, simply allows you to take more control over your TV viewing.

7876,Help with OTA antenna for football season,"I'd like to try and help you out!. Without writing a book and giving you a bigger headache:), I'll try to condense it and if you have more questions, just reply and I'll do what I can.For your antenna: I think you'd be better with an omni-directional antenna, they do make flat ones with 2 horizontal wings that is for vhf. Also, make sure that the antenna has an amplifier. Disregard the distance claims on antennas, they are notoriously over rated for distance. Price also doesn't translate into better reception. Distance from transmitter, strength of signal that the network is sending. antenna height, terrain and most important DIRECTION TO THE TRANSMITTERS. Looks like your closest Fox station is Southwest, your NBC is Northwest and the others are North. Trying to pick those up without having to constantly re orient the antenna is going to be close to impossible. The omni directional aimed WEST would be halfway between everything but that's a very wide area. Some of the outdoor antennas do have a remote that controls a motor that will allow you to move the antenna remotely.FYI: All of my transmitters are within 10 degrees of each other facing northwest, all are 19-25 miles away, I'm using a $35 RCA omni directional, rated for 55 miles but I think with my terrain, etc it's more like 30, with an amp and it is placed in my window sill at about 3 feet from the floor and I get great reception.Make sure that your coax cable is RG6, try not to use a splitter but if have to, make sure to put a terminator on the unused connection(s).FYI: I use an hd homerun with the antenna connected to the homerun and the homerun connected to my router via ethernet and stream it all to my tv's, I'm extremely satisfied with it, but won't get into all these details, just thought you may be interested.

7882,YTTV or Hulu Live?,"For the longest time, the YTTV had the advantage of being a better video service than Hulu. Hulu would buffer all the time while YTTV wouldn’t buffer at all. But that has basically been resolved on hulu’s End so it comes down to the content of Hulu vs the features of YTTV, which I think Hulu wins out on pretty easily. Hulu with Live Tv can come with its no commercial streaming library (basically no commercials except like 5 or 6 ABC shows that have contractual obligations) for 43.99 I believe. The channel selection is also wider on Hulu. The one biiiig advantage of YTTV is that it comes with unlimited DVR while Hulu comes with 50 hours in its plan, with the option to go to 200 for 15 dollars (not worth it). However, I think Hulu’s DVR storage will expand as the service matures, though i doubt itll have have unlimited like YTTV as that is backed by Google. This problem is mitigated a bit by the fact that a lot of the stuff you might be recording will be on Hulu’s streaming catalog. You can skip commercials on all DVR stuff for both.

You’ll probably be able to bundle with that Disney VOD and ESPN+ service for a cheaper price with Hulu, if that interests you at all. Just my opinion tho.

I have never used their Live TV service since the overlap between the content they offer vs the content that I wanted allowed me to immediately eliminate them from consideration when I was making my plans.  (I do have HBO through Hulu which allows me to watch live channels so I don't know if that's different than the standard Live TV interface.  I'm betting it's the same)  I have to say though, unless the interface for Live TV is drastically different from regular Hulu Plus, it's the worst I've ever seen by far.  YTTV is also the my favorite by far so that's an easy win for YTTV.  My recommendation is to start a trial for each to see which you like better.  When I first cut the cord I did trials of DTVNOW, SlingTV, and YTTV as they best met my needs.  Didn't take long to choose YTTV as my favorite and then when Philo came around it made the perfect compliment.

You can skip commercials during your DVR recordings but not VOD (pretty standard).  A few months ago it seemed to get much worse, sometimes happening within a day (or hours) where before it usually seemed to take several.  This became especially obvious when they allowed the option to choose a recording and more often than not you could see your DVR recording but not actually play it (complete with disclaimer that the network had disallowed it). This seems to have softened up some recently, most noticeably with Fox, but is still present.  This forced VOD also seems to expire as I've played catch up at times and only had to watch the VOD versions of some episodes.  Personally I find it an annoyance but only a minor one.  I've complained to them about it, as has everyone else I'm sure, but for me the service has so many other advantages over the others that it's barely a blip on my radar.

You need the TMNGO app to do that, and in order to get that you need first a basic cable sub, then you need a premium channel sub, that gets you HBO, Showtime etc. Then and only then can you use TMNGO with your sub to watch the latest HBO shows. A better alternative if you only watch a couple shows, like say you mainly watch Game of Thrones or Westworld, you can go on Google Play Movies and TV and just buy the seasons  / episodes you want. An entire season is like 15-25$ so if you only watch 3-4 shows during the year its a fraction of the cost of the cable sub + premium channel sub (which usually is about 80$ a month).   So lets say you only watch 4 HBO shows, well that would cost you about the same as a single month of subscriptions. The shows you buy on Google Play Movies and TV are very accessible, You can watch them either through the playstore, the Google Play Movies and TV app or through YouTube itself.

8163,Is Silicon Dust Streaming Service Making A Big Mistake?,"The lack of Roku support, even if you have an HDHomeRun Extend with transcoding functionality, is definitely a problem they need to fix.But otherwise most of the downsides listed in this article would be viewed as an upside for those that the HDHomeRuns were made for. Power users that wanted a network tuner that can tie into advanced local DVR setups like Plex or Channels. Being able to locally record cable channels is a huge upside for many people.Is it a concern that they might not get enough subscribers to cover the licensing costs? Maybe, but I doubt Silicon Dust would've launched this service if they didn't already account for this. They know exactly the kind of people that buy their hardware, and they tailor made this service just for them.

This service isn't necessarily meant to displace options like Vue, Sling, etc.; it's meant to be a value-add for the HDHomeRun hardware.  And honestly, to me, being able to have everything in one app, and not having to switch between, say, the HDHomeRun app and the Vue app, is a fantastic thing.Also, to me at least, being able to record directly to hardware I control is a feature, not a problem.

8166,Is Silicon Dust Streaming Service Making A Big Mistake?,"IMHO, their biggest mistake was rolling this out with half their channels in one time zone and half in the other. That is just stupid IMHO and seems like just a purely lazy implementation.The second biggest mistake, or maybe tied for first, is lack of third party support. Sure, I know it is coming (hopefully), but outside of hacks that still don't deliver 100% functionality due to the above timezone issue, the only way to use the service right now officially is live through the native, and kind of crappy, app, which of course requires direct LAN connectivity to the HDHR. They should have worked with these third party companies from the get go so things were ready for release. And maybe actually beta test with customers so they wouldn't have to redo all their website info/FAQ when people started complaining about the issues they found within minutes of release.And in third place for bad decisions -- the price. At $25, this would be amazing. $30 is probably still fair for all the sports stuff. But $35? That is what most people pay YTTV for and they get many more channels, out of the box functionality across basically everything, and 9-month DVR (yes, I know VOD sucks). Now granted, rumor has it Google is losing money on YTTV even at the $40 price point, so maybe HDHR's $35 is what the minimum sustainable rate is, with some profit, for what they deliver. But competition is getting fierce and while they do offer something no one else does, and I love the idea of roll your own DVR, they are limiting themselves to a niche demographic already, so pricing people out isn't the best idea. And while I know many people love ESPN and sports, I think that they would have been much better to do a Philo-like roll out initially ($20 or so) without the sports stuff and then offered the rest as add-ons.IMHO of course.","[('IMHO', 'ORG'), ('half', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('half', 'CARDINAL'), ('second', 'ORDINAL'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('third', 'ORDINAL'), ('100%', 'PERCENT'), ('LAN', 'ORG'), ('HDHR', 'ORG'), ('third', 'ORDINAL'), ('FAQ', 'ORG'), ('minutes', 'TIME'), ('third', 'ORDINAL'), ('25', 'MONEY'), ('30', 'MONEY'), ('35', 'MONEY'), ('9-month', 'CARDINAL'), ('DVR', 'ORG'), ('VOD', 'ORG'), ('Google', 'ORG'), ('40', 'MONEY'), ('HDHR', 'ORG'), ('35', 'MONEY'), ('DVR', 'ORG'), ('ESPN', 'ORG'), ('Philo', 'GPE'), ('20', 'MONEY')]"

8306,"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","Using all of them, PSVue stands out.  Hulu is fine, but I tried it before they redid the UI and the live TV access sucked before that but I understand the UI is supposed to be better now.  Hulu was a bit more expensive because DVR with ability to skip commercials is $15, but it includes HULU VOD library.So if you use Hulu a lot already, the try them out as it’s nice to have it all in one service and live TV is very stable.  But my other choice is Vue as a stand-alone service.That being said, they all have different channel availability so first figure out what channels you want, then see who offers them, then compare pricing.DirecTV Now has eastern feeds of “cable” channels and Vue has western (at least in California) which is one detail that affected me (program schedules.)  DTV NOW also has one of the most comprehensive channels offerings for the package price IMO.  But DTV Now is also probably one of the most problematic.No one is a clear winner.  Compare based on channel offerings and go from there.YoutubeTV is great but the DVR is usually just VOD (with ads) and they don’t have the channels I want.  Philo is fine with great DVR/VOD but very limited channel selection.

Also bc Hulu works on literally every device I own that makes a difference too. I'm undecided on if I will keep the expanded DVR or not when my trial of that is over. I think I will stick with Hulu though. I also have an antenna to get my locals but also like having them available in the app. I have also tried DTVN but it was a buggy mess and only had 2 local channels and a very buggy 20 hour DVR that just became widely available when I left them.

8312,"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","For my needs PS Vue works well.  Sports is a big focus and it covers all the sports I need including regionals for the $50 Core plan.  And for this time of year it has the option to add NFL Redzone.  While some other services may sound cheaper in the base plans. Often by the time you upgrade to get Fox Sports regionals NFL network etc.  you are paying more.  The base 40 DTV Now for example jumps to at least $55 (maybe $65 if you want NBA TV) and doesn’t include all the for example with DTV Now with 3 less streams than $50 Vue.   YouTube TV covers sports well for $40.  But it was missing must haves for the wife like HGTV that Vue included and did not have NFL network which I want this time of year.  Of course if you don’t care much about sports none of that matters.Vue prices include things like 5 streams 28 day unlimited DVR, the ability to pause and rewind live TV (which options like DirecTV Now do not have) all included for that price.  Where most others upcharge to have more than 1 or 2 simultaneous streams or to have a DVR.  If you are perhaps single and don’t need lots of streams or don’t use DVR much you may not care.  But if you have a large family where multiple people are streaming it’s a consideration.  Also I find Vue and YTTV to be the most technically sound and reliable (I don’t have much experience with Sling and Hulu Live though).  Like Vue YTTV includes an unlimited DVR which goes out to 9 months!  And it includes 3 streams free which while not as much as Vue, it’s more than most offer.  The biggest issue with Vue would be if they have your local channels.  In my area (Dallas) we are spoiled in that every service but Sling has ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox affiliates (Sling doesn’t have CBS at all) so you will want to see what locals are in your area if that’s important. DirecTV Now covers the most overall content so you will need to think about that.  Take that for what it’s worth though as if you only watch 7 channels regularly having others “just in case” may not matter.  One of the most common things that comes up is DirecTV Now and Sling (both owned by cable companies) have Viacom channels where YTTV, Vue, and Hulu currently don’t.  There are ways around that though. adding $16 Philo can fill the Viacom gap for example.  Or I’ve found the little Viacom content we watched is available on free apps not needing a sign in.  That’s something you will need to evaluate.","[('PS Vue', 'ORG'), ('50', 'MONEY'), ('NFL', 'ORG'), ('Fox Sports', 'PERSON'), ('NFL', 'ORG'), ('40', 'CARDINAL'), ('at least $55', 'MONEY'), ('maybe $65', 'MONEY'), ('NBA', 'ORG'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('YouTube', 'NORP'), ('40', 'MONEY'), ('HGTV that Vue', 'ORG'), ('NFL', 'ORG'), ('this time of year', 'DATE'), ('5', 'CARDINAL'), ('28 day', 'DATE'), ('DVR', 'ORG'), ('more than 1', 'CARDINAL'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('DVR', 'ORG'), (' ', 'ORG'), ('DVR', 'ORG'), (' ', 'ORG'), ('Sling', 'NORP'), ('Hulu Live', 'ORG'), ('Vue YTTV', 'ORG'), ('DVR', 'ORG'), ('9 months', 'DATE'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('Vue', 'LOC'), ('Vue', 'LOC'), ('Dallas', 'GPE'), ('Sling', 'ORG'), ('ABC', 'ORG'), ('NBC', 'ORG'), ('CBS', 'ORG'), ('Fox', 'ORG'), ('Sling', 'ORG'), ('CBS', 'ORG'), ('Now', 'DATE'), ('7', 'CARDINAL'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('Sling', 'ORG'), ('Viacom', 'ORG'), ('YTTV', 'ORG'), ('Vue', 'ORG'), ('Hulu', 'GPE'), ('16', 'MONEY'), ('Philo', 'GPE'), ('Viacom', 'ORG'), ('Viacom', 'ORG')]"

8477,Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,"Of these three, I only have Hulu. I do sometimes subscribe to CBS All Access and I use Hoopla Digital etc.Regarding why:1. I didn't use Amazon Prime video much because frequently only one or two seasons of a tv show was available. I rarely watch movies. The price increase and the extra unwanted stuff (NFL and Twitch) made it less affordable. I typically didn't get Amazon Prime shipping in two days after an item shipped. (And the minimum is currently $25 so not too bad.)2. Hulu has a single stream HD plan for $7.99 (currently $5.99 for me) and I don't really care that much about ads or not since I already have ads on OTA anyway. It is nice when no ads is available but I don't feel like spending extra on it. I really didn't want to pay for an extra stream just to get HD and Netflix had dropped the shows I had been watching on catch up half way through the shows so then I had to turn to Hulu or Amazon to watch the end of the series. Secondly with Hulu, I generally don't have to wait a year. I strongly prefer on demand to Live Tv so even when i use CBS All Access, I don't watch live. So for me, cable tv with its equipment rental, horrible remotes, guides with ads, lousy closed captioning, lack of decent on demand, pricey plans, taxes and other fees is simply that similar to the streaming services that i use.

TiVos version is flawless...so I've been spoiled.  But itis unrealistic for a crew of 2 developers to tag every episode like TiVo does.I've also found that my guide info has been incorrect for my recordings in Plex.  I recorded Dateline for my wife to try out Plex, and none of the recordings had the proper description to them.I'm not a big fan of removing commercials like Plex DVR does.
